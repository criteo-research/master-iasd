# Syst√®mes, paradigmes et langages pour les Big Data

TD1-2 notebooks are working on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
Installing everything on Google Colab makes it easier to understand what you need to use PySpark.  
  
Before, we have tested:
- [Databricks Community](https://community.databricks.com/): lack of stability 
- [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) on docker container: much time to set up and depends of the workstation environment of the students
These reasons made the choice to prefer using Google Colab, it works well.
